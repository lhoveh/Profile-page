This is my first exercise involving html/css/javascript/react.

It consists of a profile page (assuming it's made for and by a professional front-end developer), based on some wix template.

It's linked to some other exercises, saved as "projects portfolio".

Finally, it is also an exercise/practice of GitHub itself.
